# IoTSpy — Implementation Plan & Session Handoff

This document captures the phased implementation plan, current progress, and everything needed for a new contributor (or a new Claude Code session) to resume work without losing context.

---

## Project context

IoTSpy is an IoT network security research platform. The goal is a self-hosted tool that can be pointed at any IoT device to capture, inspect, and manipulate its network traffic, then run automated pen-test checks against the device.

Full architecture: [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md)
README / quick start: [`README.md`](../README.md)

## Resuming this project

### What is done (Phase 1 — complete)

The entire Phase 1 backend and frontend are scaffolded and functional:

**Backend:**
- `ExplicitProxyServer` listens on `:8888`, handles HTTP and HTTPS CONNECT.
- TLS MITM works via BouncyCastle dynamic CA (root CA auto-generated, per-host leaf certs cached).
- Polly 8 resilience: per-host circuit breaker + retry + timeout for TCP connect; timeout-only for TLS handshake.
- EF Core 10 with SQLite default; Postgres switchable via config. `DateTimeOffset` stored as Unix ms (long) via `ValueConverter` for SQLite compatibility.
- JWT single-user auth with PBKDF2 (`Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2`) password hash stored in DB.
- SignalR hub `/hubs/traffic` streams every captured request in real time.
- Five REST controllers fully implemented.
- OpenAPI (Scalar) in Development mode at `/scalar`.

**Frontend (`frontend/`):**
- Vite 6 + React 19 + TypeScript; dev server on port 3000.
- Auth flow: `/setup` (first-run password) → `/login` → dashboard. JWT in `localStorage`.
- Split-pane capture dashboard with draggable divider: capture list on left, request/response/TLS detail on right.
- `CaptureFilterBar`: filter by device, method, status code, host, date range, body search.
- SignalR live stream via `useTrafficStream` — new captures prepended in real time.
- Proxy start/stop + settings modal (port, listen address, TLS/body capture flags).
- CA download link (no auth required on that endpoint).
- React Context + `useReducer` for auth state; no Redux.

### What to do next

The highest-value next task is **Docker packaging (Phase 1.16)**:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile target: src/IoTSpy.Api
# Multi-stage: build with dotnet:10-sdk, run with dotnet:10-aspnet
```

Then proceed to Phase 2 (ARP spoof / gateway mode + MQTT decoder).

## Key design decisions already made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy modes | Three (explicit, gateway, ARP) all feed one capture pipeline | Uniform storage/analysis regardless of interception method |
| Storage | SQLite default, Postgres pluggable | Zero-config for local use; scales with Postgres |
| Auth | Single-user JWT, BCrypt hash in DB | Simple; IoTSpy is a personal/team tool, not multi-tenant |
| TLS MITM | BouncyCastle (pure .NET) | No native dependency; works cross-platform |
| Resilience | Per-host Polly circuit breaker | A dead IoT cloud endpoint must not stall the whole proxy |
| Real-time | SignalR | Native .NET, easy JS client, supports group subscriptions per device |
| Frontend | Vite 6 + React 19 + TypeScript | Lightweight, no framework overhead; compatible with existing CORS config |
| AI mock | Pluggable (Claude / OpenAI / Ollama) | Avoid lock-in; local Ollama for offline use |

## Naming conventions

- Namespace / project prefix: `IoTSpy` (capital I, o, T, S — not `Iotspy` or `IOTSPY`)
- Solution file: `IoTSpy.sln`
- Docker image / container names: `iotspy` (lowercase)
- Git repo directory: `iotspy/` (lowercase, existing)

---

## Configuration quick reference

```jsonc
// src/IoTSpy.Api/appsettings.json (key sections)
{
  "Database": { "Provider": "sqlite|postgres", "ConnectionString": "..." },
  "Auth": { "JwtSecret": "<32+ chars>", "PasswordHash": "" },
  "Frontend": { "Origin": "http://localhost:3000" },
  "Urls": "http://localhost:5000",
  "Resilience": { /* timeouts, retry, circuit-breaker */ }
}
```

Environment variable override uses double-underscore: `Auth__JwtSecret=...`

---

## Running the backend locally

```bash
cd /path/to/iotspy

# Required env var
export Auth__JwtSecret="replace-with-32-char-minimum-secret"

dotnet run --project src/IoTSpy.Api
# → http://localhost:5000
# → Scalar API docs: http://localhost:5000/scalar  (Development only)
```

## Notes for Claude Code sessions

- The `.claude/` directory in the repo root stores tool permissions and session memory for this project.
- Project memory is maintained at `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-annag-source-repos-IoTSpy/memory/MEMORY.md`.
- The `IoTSpy.Protocols`, `IoTSpy.Scanner`, and `IoTSpy.Manipulation` projects are empty stubs — no source files yet, just `.csproj` files with placeholder dependencies.
- EF Core migrations are in `src/IoTSpy.Storage/Migrations/` (`InitialCreate` applied). Run `dotnet ef migrations add <Name>` from repo root when adding new entities/properties.
- `DateTimeOffset` properties are stored as Unix milliseconds (`long`) via a `ValueConverter` in `IoTSpyDbContext` — required for SQLite `ORDER BY` compatibility.
- No tests exist yet. Recommended: unit tests for `CertificateAuthority` + integration tests for proxy intercept logic.
