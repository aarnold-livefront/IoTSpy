## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Where do I find API documentation?**  
A: [README.md](../README.md#api-reference) has all endpoints; Scalar docs at `http://localhost:5000/scalar` in Development mode.

**Q: How do I add a new protocol decoder?**  
A: Follow "Backend feature" checklist in [AGENT-NOTES.md](AGENT-NOTES.md#backend-feature), implement `IProtocolDecoder<T>`, add tests.

**Q: Why is everything async?**  
A: ASP.NET Core best practice; avoids blocking threads; allows concurrent request handling.

**Q: Why split PLAN.md into multiple files?**  
A: Token efficiency — load only what you need; easier to navigate; less cognitive overhead.

**Q: What's the roadmap after Phase 21?**  
A: See [PHASES-ROADMAP.md](PHASES-ROADMAP.md#future-enhancement-areas-phases-22) for ideas (offline mode, mobile app, ML anomaly detection, etc.).
